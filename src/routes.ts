  // Håkan's principle:
  //
  // say you add an issue, that'll produce a release node
  // then we can check whether that release node is properly connected
  // into the release tree - 
  // in other words, are the release nodes there that the issue
  // has relationships with?
  //
  // this limits the scope of impact when we add an issue
  // won't need to scan the entire release tree
  // so performance is constant when you add issues
  //
  // Abe's notes:
  //
  // a Release node is what we had previously called a Version node
  // its properties are type (Feature or Maintenance) and version (e.g., 3.2.1)
  // Maintenance releases are connected by NEXT relationships
  // each Maintenance release has a PARENT relationship to a Feature release
  // and if we create Major releases:
  // each Feature release has a PARENT relationship to a Major release
